<h2>Time incorrect?</h2>
<p>
If the Sehri and&#x2F;or Iftar time appear to be incorrect.<br/>
You can change the calculations used under<b>Settings</b>.<br/>
You can choose from one of the predefined values or set these to <b>Other</b> and use the provided sliders to fine tune the calculations.
</p>
<h2>How do I set a custom alarm?</h2>
<p>
To add a custom ringtone, put your MP3 in the Alarms folder under internal storage (some devices may call this &#x2F;storage&#x2F;sdcard0). If the folder does not exist you can create it.
</p>
<h2>How do I set my location?</h2>
<p>
Even though detecting your location should not be a problem (it should be detected automatically), there is an option to manually set your location just in case you have any issues.<br/>
Simply click <b>SET LOCATION</b> in the action bar and type your location.<br/>
You will be presented with a list of suggestions; simply select one.
